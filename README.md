# Python Learning Notes

My notes on Python and coding questions, kept as Jupyter notebooks. Each note puts
the problem write-up (Markdown), the solution (code), and its tests together in one file.

## Quick start

```powershell
uv sync                                   # install dependencies (first time / new machine)
uv run new_note.py "Valid Parentheses"    # create notes/000N_valid_parentheses.ipynb
uv run jupyter lab                        # or just open the notebook in PyCharm
```

## 1. What is a Jupyter notebook?

A notebook (`.ipynb`) is a list of **cells**. There are two kinds:

| Cell type    | What it holds                        | When you run it                    |
|--------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Markdown** | Formatted text, tables, math, links  | It turns into formatted text       |
| **Code**     | Python                               | Python runs it and shows output below |

All code cells share one running Python process, called the **kernel**. Once you run a
cell that defines `def solve(...)`, every later cell can use `solve`. This is the
most important idea to understand about notebooks:

> ⚠️ **Order matters, and so does what you've already run.** The kernel remembers
> what you *ran*, not what's currently written on the page. If you edit a function,
> **re-run that cell** before running the tests again. If things get confusing,
> use **Restart Kernel and Run All**.

## 2. Opening notebooks

### Option A: in PyCharm (you're already using it)
1. Open any `.ipynb` file. PyCharm shows it as a notebook.
2. At the top, make sure the interpreter/kernel is this project's `.venv`.
3. Click ▶ next to a cell, or press **Shift+Enter**, to run it.

### Option B: JupyterLab in the browser
From the project folder:
```powershell
uv run jupyter lab
```
A browser tab opens. Use the file panel on the left to open notebooks.
Press **Ctrl+C** in the terminal to stop the server when you're finished.

## 3. Keyboard shortcuts

Jupyter has two modes:
- **Edit mode**: you're typing inside a cell (green/blue cursor).
- **Command mode**: the whole cell is selected. Press **Esc** to get here.

| Shortcut              | Mode    | Action                                   |
|-----------------------|---------|------------------------------------------|
| `Shift + Enter`       | any     | Run cell, move to the next one           |
| `Ctrl + Enter`        | any     | Run cell, stay on it                     |
| `Alt + Enter`         | any     | Run cell, insert a new cell below        |
| `Esc` / `Enter`       | —       | Switch to command mode / edit mode       |
| `A` / `B`             | command | Insert cell **A**bove / **B**elow        |
| `D` `D`               | command | Delete cell (press D twice)              |
| `M` / `Y`             | command | Change cell to **M**arkdown / code       |
| `Z`                   | command | Undo cell deletion                       |
| `Shift + ↑/↓`         | command | Select several cells                     |
| `0` `0`               | command | Restart kernel                           |
| `Tab`                 | edit    | Autocomplete                             |
| `Shift + Tab`         | edit    | Show a function's signature/docs (JupyterLab) |

These are JupyterLab's shortcuts. PyCharm's notebook editor uses most of them too.

## 4. Workflow for a new coding question

1. **Create a new note** from the template:
   ```powershell
   uv run new_note.py "Valid Parentheses"
   # or fill in more of the header at the same time:
   uv run new_note.py "Valid Parentheses" -d Easy -t "stack, string" -u https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/
   ```
   This creates `notes/0002_valid_parentheses.ipynb`, numbered automatically, with the
   title and today's date already filled in. Run `uv run new_note.py -h` to see all options.
2. **Fill in the rest of the header table** and the problem statement.
3. **Write your thinking** before you write any code: brute force, key insight, edge cases.
4. **Run the Setup cell** (it loads `ipytest`).
5. **Write the solution** in the Solution cell and run it.
6. **Add test cases**, then run the Tests cell. Green dots = passing, `F` = failing.
7. Fix the code → **re-run the solution cell** → re-run the tests.
8. Fill in **Takeaways**. This is the part that helps most when you review later.

### Let Claude Code take the note

This repo ships a [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) skill in
`.claude/skills/take-note/`. Paste a problem and your solution into Claude Code and ask it
to take a note (or type `/take-note`). It will:

1. create the note with `new_note.py` (numbered by the LeetCode problem number),
2. fill every section: problem, thinking, your solution plus the best-practice solution(s)
   with complexities, tests over every approach, a `%timeit` comparison, and takeaways
   (the pattern, your mistakes, related problems),
3. run the notebook to check every test passes,
4. explain in chat why your solution is slow and what pattern to remember.

It only commits when you ask it to.

### How the tests work

The template uses [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) through
[ipytest](https://github.com/chmp/ipytest), so you can run pytest from inside a notebook:

```python
%%ipytest -q

CASES = [
    ([2, 7, 11, 15], 9, [0, 1]),
    ([3, 3], 6, [0, 1]),
]

@pytest.mark.parametrize("nums, target, expected", CASES)
def test_two_sum(nums, target, expected):
    assert two_sum(nums, target) == expected
```

- `%%ipytest` at the top of a cell runs every `test_*` function in that cell.
- `parametrize` runs the test once for each row in `CASES`. To add a case, add a row.
- You can test several implementations against the same cases. See `notes/0001_two_sum.ipynb`.
- For a quick check without pytest, a plain `assert solve(x) == y` in any cell also works.

### Useful "magic" commands

| Magic             | What it does                                       |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `%timeit expr`    | Times a single expression (good for comparing solutions) |
| `%%time`          | Times the whole cell (put it on the first line)    |
| `%%ipytest`       | Runs the pytest tests defined in the cell          |
| `%who`            | Lists the variables currently in memory            |
| `?obj`            | Shows the docs for `obj`, e.g. `?sorted`           |

## 5. Markdown syntax cheat sheet

Write these in **Markdown cells**, then run the cell to see the formatted result.
Double-click a rendered cell to edit it again.

### Headings
```markdown
# Heading 1   (one per notebook: the title)
## Heading 2  (sections)
### Heading 3 (sub-sections)
```

### Text styling
| You type                 | You get              |
|--------------------------|----------------------|
| `**bold**`               | **bold**             |
| `*italic*`               | *italic*             |
| `~~strikethrough~~`      | ~~strikethrough~~    |
| `` `inline code` ``      | `inline code`        |
| `[link](https://python.org)` | [link](https://python.org) |

Leave a **blank line** between paragraphs. A single line break is not enough.

### Lists
```markdown
- bullet item
- another item
  - nested item (indent 2 spaces)

1. numbered item
2. second item

- [ ] todo checkbox
- [x] done checkbox
```

### Code blocks
Use three backticks, plus a language name to get syntax highlighting:

````markdown
```python
def hello():
    print("hi")
```
````

### Blockquotes (good for problem statements)
```markdown
> Given an array of integers, return ...
```

### Tables
```markdown
| Approach    | Time    | Space |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| Brute force | O(n^2)  | O(1)  |
| Hash map    | O(n)    | O(n)  |
```
Add colons to the dash row to align columns: `|:---|` left, `|:---:|` center, `|---:|` right.

### Math (useful for complexity)
```markdown
Inline: $O(n \log n)$

Block:
$$
\sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
$$
```
Common symbols: `\log`, `n^2`, `x_i`, `\le`, `\ge`, `\ne`, `\cdot`, `\infty`.

### Horizontal line, images
```markdown
---
![alt text](path/or/url/to/image.png)
```

### Escaping
Put a backslash before a character to show it literally: `\*not italic\*`, `\#not a heading`.

## 6. Tips and common pitfalls

- **"NameError: name 'solve' is not defined"**: the cell that defines it hasn't been
  run yet. Run the cells from the top, or use *Run All*.
- **Tests still fail after a fix**: you edited the function but didn't re-run its cell.
- **Before you finish a note**, do *Restart Kernel → Run All* to make sure it works
  from top to bottom.
- **Long or infinite loop?** Use the ■ *Interrupt* button (or press `I` `I` in command mode).
- **Clearing outputs** (*Edit → Clear All Outputs*) before committing keeps git diffs small.
- **Installing a package**: run `uv add <package>` in the terminal, then restart the kernel.
